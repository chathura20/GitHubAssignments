Next, I would attempt to establish a common format by converting all inputs as strings. If there are numeric values, I would convert those to the corresponding sentiment word. With the trends that were identified, I would also implement it in this step. To check my progress, I would group the data by sentiment scores and check for scores that occurred only once. If the number of scores that occurred only once decreases after each format conversion, I would deem this as a success."
