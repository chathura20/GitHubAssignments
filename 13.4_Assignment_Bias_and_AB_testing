Assignment
For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment.

You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
The response rate of the different versions of the advertising emails maybe biased by the difference in seasons in the groups. For example,
bathing suits sales experience a high during summer seasons where people are most likely to go on a beach vacation.
The email sent out in February will be unlikely to receive a response from the customer compared to the other sent in May since May
is the beginning of summer.

You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
Anxiety is a common condition among people. However, unless it is serve, people will unlikely be willing to find a treatment, 
such as attending therapry at a clinic. Thus, the anxiety rate at the clinic is biased by the individual's desire to seek help based on
his or her anxiety level.

You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
If "first week" is being interpreted as the first week of the website being launched, then this experiment is biased by the website's 
launch date. For example, if a new website is launched, it will receive an increase in website visits because people are curious about
a new product. The amount of increased visits may not be a direct effect of a new ad billboard based campaign.

You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
Depending on the type of product the company provides, this experiment will be biased by the customers usage of the product. For example,
if the company is a clothing store, the loyalty program will most likely not influence the customer to return within the first week 
since people generally do not shop more than once per week. Monitoring the loyalty program over a longer period amount of time,
such as by month, would provide better insight of the loyalty program experiment.
